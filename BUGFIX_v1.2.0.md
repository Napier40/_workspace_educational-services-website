# Bug Fix for v1.2.0 - Customer New Request Route

## Issue Description
**Error**: `TypeError: The view function for 'customer.new_request' did not return a valid response. The function either returned None or ended without a return statement.`

## Root Cause
The `new_request` route in `app/routes.py` was missing a return statement for GET requests. The function handled POST requests correctly but didn't return anything when users accessed the form page (GET request).

## Fix Applied
Added the missing return statement for GET requests:

```python
@customer_bp.route('/new_request', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@login_required
def new_request():
    if current_user.is_admin():
        return redirect(url_for('admin.dashboard'))
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # ... POST handling code ...
        flash('Service request submitted successfully!', 'success')
        return redirect(url_for('customer.dashboard'))
    
    # FIX: Added missing return statement for GET requests
    return render_template('customer/new_request.html')
```

## Files Modified
- `app/routes.py` - Added missing return statement on line ~410

## Testing
- ✅ New request page loads correctly (GET request)
- ✅ Form submission works correctly (POST request)
- ✅ All other routes continue to function normally
- ✅ No regression issues identified

## Impact
- **Severity**: High (prevented customers from accessing new request form)
- **Affected Users**: All customers trying to submit new service requests
- **Resolution**: Immediate fix applied and tested

## Prevention
This type of error can be prevented by:
1. Comprehensive route testing during development
2. Ensuring all code paths in view functions return valid responses
3. Using linting tools that detect missing return statements
4. Implementing automated testing for all routes

## Version
- **Fixed in**: v1.2.0 (updated export package)
