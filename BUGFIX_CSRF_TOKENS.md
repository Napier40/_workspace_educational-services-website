# Bugfix: Missing CSRF Tokens

**Date**: June 22, 2025  
**Issue**: CSRF token missing error on form submissions  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  

## Problem Description

Several forms in the application were missing CSRF tokens, causing form submissions to fail with "The CSRF token is missing" error.

### Error Message
```
The CSRF token is missing
```

## Root Cause

While CSRF protection was enabled in the Flask application (`CSRFProtect()` initialized), many forms were missing the required CSRF token hidden input field.

## Solution Applied

Added CSRF tokens to all POST forms that were missing them:

### Authentication Forms
- ✅ `app/templates/auth/login.html` - Login form
- ✅ `app/templates/auth/register.html` - Registration form

### Customer Forms  
- ✅ `app/templates/customer/new_request.html` - Service request form
- ✅ `app/templates/customer/profile.html` - Profile update form
- ✅ `app/templates/customer/request_detail.html` - Pricing approval form
- ✅ `app/templates/customer/my_plan.html` - Plan change form

### Admin Forms
- ✅ `app/templates/admin/service_pricing.html` - Delete plan form
- ✅ `app/templates/admin/edit_service_pricing.html` - Edit pricing form
- ✅ `app/templates/admin/request_detail.html` - Update request form

## CSRF Token Implementation

Added the following line to each POST form:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}"/>
```

## Forms That Don't Need CSRF Tokens

The following forms use GET method and don't require CSRF tokens:
- Filter forms in reports (income_report.html, top_customers_report.html)
- Search and filter forms in admin panels

## Testing

Verified CSRF protection is working:
- ✅ CSRF tokens generate correctly
- ✅ Forms submit successfully with tokens
- ✅ Forms are rejected without tokens
- ✅ All POST operations protected

## Files Modified

1. `app/templates/auth/login.html`
2. `app/templates/auth/register.html`
3. `app/templates/customer/new_request.html`
4. `app/templates/customer/profile.html`
5. `app/templates/customer/request_detail.html`
6. `app/templates/customer/my_plan.html`
7. `app/templates/admin/service_pricing.html`
8. `app/templates/admin/edit_service_pricing.html`
9. `app/templates/admin/request_detail.html`

## Security Impact

This fix ensures:
- ✅ Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
- ✅ All form submissions are properly authenticated
- ✅ Compliance with security best practices
- ✅ User data integrity maintained
