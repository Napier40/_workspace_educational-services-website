# Bugfix: Model Relationship Query Issue

**Date**: June 22, 2025  
**Issue**: NameError in User model method  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  

## Problem Description

The `User.get_top_customers_by_conversions()` method was attempting to call `.count()` and `.filter()` methods on a relationship that returns a list rather than a query object.

### Error Message
```
TypeError: list.count() takes exactly one argument (0 given)
```

## Root Cause

The SQLAlchemy relationship `service_requests` in the User model was configured with `lazy=True`, which means it returns a list of objects rather than a query object when accessed.

```python
# This was the problematic code:
total_requests = customer.service_requests.count()  # Error: list has no count() method
completed_requests = customer.service_requests.filter(...)  # Error: list has no filter() method
```

## Solution

Modified the method to work with the list-based relationship:

```python
# Fixed code:
total_requests = len(customer.service_requests)  # Use len() for lists
completed_requests = len([req for req in customer.service_requests if req.status == 'completed'])  # Use list comprehension
```

## Files Modified

- `app/models.py` - Fixed `get_top_customers_by_conversions()` method

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Method now returns correct results
- ✅ No performance impact
- ✅ All other functionality remains intact

## Prevention

For future development:
- Be aware of SQLAlchemy relationship lazy loading behavior
- Test relationship methods thoroughly
- Consider using `lazy='dynamic'` for query-like behavior when needed
