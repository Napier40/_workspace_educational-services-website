# Environment variables are largely controlled by TestConfig in conftest.py
# and the app factory.
# FLASK_DEBUG is set to 0 (False) via TestConfig.
# DATABASE_URL is set to sqlite:///:memory: via TestConfig.
# WTF_CSRF_ENABLED is set to False via TestConfig.
# SECRET_KEY is set via TestConfig.
# MAIL_BACKEND is set to 'locmem' via TestConfig.
# LOG_LEVEL can be set via TestConfig.

# If pytest-env is installed, you could use:
# [pytest]
# env_files =
#     .env.test
# Or:
# env =
#   FLASK_DEBUG = 0
#   OTHER_VAR = value
# However, relying on the Flask app's TestConfig is often cleaner.
